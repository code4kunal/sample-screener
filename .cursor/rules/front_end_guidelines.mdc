## Frontend Guidelines Document

### Design System
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Adopt shadcn/ui for components: modals, buttons, tabs, cards
- Apply consistent spacing, font hierarchy, and color palette
- All pages should follow a responsive grid layout

### Page Structure
- **Layout**: Global header, side navigation (for dashboards), and content body
- **Routing**: Next.js dynamic routes for screener and case study pages

### Components Breakdown
1. **Auth Pages**: Login, Signup (with invite code input)
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Screener List with filters and performance badges
   - Profile Overview and Subscription Plan
3. **Screener Page**:
   - Screener description
   - Chart component for analytics
   - Run backtest form and results
4. **Case Studies Page**:
   - List of articles with filters (date, tag)
   - Detail view with code snippets and images
5. **Admin Panel**:
   - User table, Invite management
   - Screener and Case Study management forms

### UX Considerations
- Use animations (Framer Motion) for smoother transitions
- Toast notifications for actions (save, errors, success)
- Skeleton screens for loading states
- Empty state components with helpful messages

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML where possible
- Keyboard navigability for major actions
- ARIA roles for modals and dynamic content
